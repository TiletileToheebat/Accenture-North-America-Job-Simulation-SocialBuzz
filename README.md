# Accenture-North-America-Job-Simulation-SocialBuzz
### Project Overview
This project was part of an Accenture job simulation where I analyzed social media content from **Social Buzz**, a platform with 500 million active users, generating 36.5 million posts annually. The objective was to identify the top 5 most popular content categories and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance user engagement.

### Tools Used
- **Excel:** For data cleaning, organization, and initial analysis.
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and uncovering key insights.
- **PowerPoint:** For presenting the final findings and recommendations.

### Key Insights
- Identified the top 5 content categories: **Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food**.
- Conducted a sentiment analysis, showing that May had the highest user engagement, with predominantly positive reactions.
- Determined that different content types performed better depending on the category (e.g., photos for animals, audio for technology).

### Recommendations
- Tailor content formats to category-specific preferences (e.g., photo content for animals, video for food and science).
- Leverage the popularity of these categories for targeted advertising to boost platform engagement and growth.
